# Generator

Generate a CI yaml file(s) - [the initial discussion](https://github.com/Ensono/taskctl/issues/16)

## Internals

The internal execution graph can be thought of as a unary tree with nodes (Stages), the root will be a taskctl "pipeline".

Where a pipeline can a collection of tasks that are executed in parallel or in an order set by the `depends on` keyword.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(first task in pipeline x) --> B(task a)
    A --> C(task b)
    A --> D(task c)
    B --> E(task e)
    C --> E(task e)
    D --> F(task d)
    F --> E
    E --> X(last task in pipeline x)
```

The example above shows `pipeline x` - starting by executing tasks a,b,c in parallel. `task d` waiting

## Implementation

Taskctl properties need to be mapped to the specific CI implementations
