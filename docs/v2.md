# V2 migration

Changes:

- Context 
    - container first class citizen 
    - default mount point in the container is /workspace/.taskctl
        - if you are referencing an absolute path this should be changed to reflect the new path. 
        - _ALTERNATIVELY_, you should use relative paths, as the `-w /taskctl` is set and you are automatically in the root of your directory

- env and envfile
    - env is now added to Context, Pipelines, and Tasks
        - It is merged in this order Context < Pipelines < Tasks - i.e. Tasks will overwrite anything set previously.
    
    - taskctl.env will be read in at a context level

- Scheduler
    - denormalized graph allowing for a unique path to the same task
